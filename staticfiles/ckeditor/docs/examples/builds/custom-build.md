# Custom build

The editor in this example was customized to offer a limited subset of editing [features](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5#core-libraries), provided mainly by the [`ckeditor5-basic-styles`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles) and [`ckeditor5-highlight`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-highlight) packages. This kind of customization is possible with a {@link builds/guides/development/custom-builds custom editor build}, perfectly tailored to the needs of the application.
