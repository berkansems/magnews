## [19.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v19.0.0...v19.1.0) (2020-05-27)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v19.1.0.

This release further refines the table feature, brings a helper for convenient typing in tight places before or after widgets (such as images or tables) and brings a major change in our code infrastructure. Most notable enhancements are:

* Pasting a table into a selected table fragment &mdash; which marks the end of the [Table selection stage III](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6297) task.
* A new [widget feature that allows typing before or after a widget](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6689) when there is no space around it.
* [Project migration to a monorepo architecture](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6466).

But we did not stop there, as the release comes with several bug fixes, too:

* [Entities handling in code blocks](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5901).
* [Potential editor crash when removing a column](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6789).
* [Editor crash when inserting a table row or column with another widget selected in the cell](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6607).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[media-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-media-embed)**: The `MediaEmbedUI#form` property was removed from the API.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `cropTable()` utility method was removed. Use the [`cropTableToDimensions()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_table_tableselection_croptable.html#static-function-cropTableToDimensions) method instead.
* **[theme-lark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark)**: A new custom `--ck-color-focus-border-coordinates` CSS property was added and the existing `--ck-color-focus-border` property now uses it internally. If your integration overrides the latter, we recommend you update the former to avoid compatibility issues with various editor UI features.

## [19.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v18.0.0...v19.0.0) (2020-04-29)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v19.0.0.

This release is focused on [further improving the table selection plugin](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6285) and includes following the enhancements:

* [An option to select an entire row or column](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6500).
* [Custom keyboard handling in tables, allowing for consistent and more convenient navigation using the keyboard](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3267).
* [Improved removing rows or columns from complex tables](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6406).
* Fixed a few cases where an editor could be crashed.

We also introduced support for [plural forms in our translation API](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6406), added the [select all feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6536) and created the `supportAllValues` option to preserve any font family or size value.

We also did several performance tweaks to improve CKEditor 5 data processing and rendering time.

A few bugs have been fixed, most notably:

* [Font retention when pasting from Microsoft Word](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6165).
* [Support for special characters in mention matching](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6398).
* [Artifact characters produced when typing  after an emoji with text transformation enabled](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6398).

Finally, this release comes with some **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* Make sure the latest version of the [`Essentials`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/essentials.html) plugin or the [`SelectAll`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_select-all_selectall-SelectAll.html) plugin is installed in your integration. Either is required for proper keystroke handling in editor widgets.
* The format of stored editor translations changed. If you use `window.CKEDITOR_TRANSLATIONS`, see [#334](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/334).
* The `translate()` function from the `translation-service` was marked as protected. See [#334](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/334).
* The `getPositionedAncestor()` helper will no longer return the passed element when it is positioned.
* The `ViewCollection` no longer has the `locale` property.
* The `ViewCollection#constructor()` no longer accepts the `locale` parameter.
* The `LabeledView` component was renamed to `LabeledFieldView`. Also, its instance of a labeled component's view is available through `LabeledFieldView#fieldView`. It replaced `LabeledView#view`.
* The `DropdownView#focusTracker` property was removed as it served no purpose.
* From now on, the `SpecialCharactersNavigationView` is an instance of the `FormHeaderView` and unnecessary `SpecialCharactersNavigationView#labelView` was removed.
* The `env.isEdge` property was removed. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#6202](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6202).

Check the list of packages below to learn more about these and other minor breaking changes.

## [18.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v17.0.0...v18.0.0) (2020-03-19)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v18.0.0. This release introduces support for [selecting multiple table cells, rows or columns](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3202) and it improves [structure retention for lists pasted from Microsoft Word](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2518).

We also modified our builds [to include the text transformation plugin](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6304) and [enabled toolbar item grouping for the inline editor and balloon editor builds](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5597).

As usual, we also fixed a couple of bugs and improved existing features, mostly in the table plugin.

Finally, this release comes with a couple of **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* Constructor for `EditingController`, `DataController` and `View` classes now require a `StylesProcessor` instance.
* Constructor for `DomConverter`, `HtmlDataProcessor` and `XmlDataProcessor` classes and the `createViewElementFromHighlightDescriptor()` function now require an instance of view document.
* The `#document` getter was removed from model nodes.
* The `GFMDataProcessor()` requires the view document instance as its first parameter.
* The `BalloonToolbar` plugin now groups the overflowing items by default.

Check the list of packages below to learn more about above and other minor breaking changes.

## [17.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v16.0.0...v17.0.0) (2020-02-19)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v17.0.0.

From the end user perspective, this release introduces [support for styling tables and table cells](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/table.html#table-and-cell-styling-tools) as well as a [new special characters picker](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/special-characters.html) feature. We also worked on improving the editor initialization and data processing performance.

From the developer perspective, we added support for [editor contexts](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_core_context-Context.html), adjusted the watchdog to work with editor contexts (which introduced breaking changes in that package) and introduced an [extensible system for parsing and normalizing CSS properties](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_stylesmap-StylesMap.html) which main goal was to make the editor better pick up certain style names in pasted/loaded content.

As usual, we also fixed a couple of bugs and improved existing features. The two features which got most improvements are image resizing and the restricted editing feature.

Finally, this release comes with a couple of **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* The decoupled document build: the highlight plugin was replaced with font color and font background color features. The upgrade path requires performing data migration or customizing the build to use the highlight feature. Refer to https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.
* The watchdog package: the `Watchdog` class was renamed and moved to a new module. See https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-watchdog/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.
* The restricted editing package: the class used by this feature to mark exceptions was changed from `ck-restricted-editing-exception` to `restricted-editing-exception`. The upgrade path requires performing data migration. Refer to https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-restricted-editing/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.

## [16.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v15.0.0...v16.0.0) (2019-12-04)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v16.0.0. This release introduces one of the most community-requested features: [code blocks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/code-blocks.html). We included a new [restricted editing](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/restricted-editing.html) plugin, too.

We also did some changes in the default UI colors to improve accessibility. In addition to that, as always, the release contains many [more improvements and bug fixes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22iteration+28%22+is%3Aclosed+-label%3Atype%3Adocs+-label%3Atype%3Atask+-label%3Apackage%3Arestricted-editing+-label%3Apackage%3Acode-block+-label%3Atype%3Afeature).

## [15.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v12.4.0...v15.0.0) (2019-10-23)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v15.0.0. This editor version introduces support for inserting [horizontal lines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/horizontal-line.html), [page breaks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/page-break.html) and [SVG images](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageupload-ImageUploadConfig.html#member-types) into the WYSIWYG editor. It also allows you to define the [document title section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/title.html) thanks to the new title plugin. The editor toolbar is now responsive which improves the UX, especially for mobile devices.

Regarding the build itself, we added the [indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html) button to the build's default setup. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1844](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1844).

From other news, we changed the versioning policy. Now, all packages will have the same major version, hence, we needed to release this one as v15.0.0 (we skipped versions 13.0.0 and 14.0.0). Read more about the [new versioning policy](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html).

## [12.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v12.3.0...v12.3.1) (2019-07-10)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.3.0 (and v12.3.1 with a [small fix](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/pull/209)). This release introduces several new features ([word count](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/word-count.html), [automatic text transformations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/text-transformation.html), [ability to control link attributes such as `target`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html#custom-link-attributes-decorators) and [block indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html)). It also brings improvements to existing features (e.g. the ["document colors" section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/font.html#documents-colors) in the font color picker dropdowns) and many bug fixes.

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.2.0. This is a minor release with many bug fixes and a new UI feature which allows to navigating between multiple balloons.

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the notes below.

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-5-v12.0.0-with-inline-widgets-and-distraction-free-editor-released/

**Important information for integration developers:** The `editor.getData()` method will return an empty string if the editor is empty (instead of returning `<p>&nbsp;</p>`). Also, if you relied on `editor.ui.view.editable`, you will now need to use `editor.ui.getEditableElement()` instead. You may also want to read the below sections and the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) to learn more.

**Important information for plugin developers:** The most important change that will affect your plugins is the removal of the `upcast-converters.js` and `downcast-converters.js` modules. You can now find those methods directly on the object returned by [`editor.conversion.for()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_conversion_conversion-Conversion.html#function-for). Other than that, see the changes described in the next section, the [engine's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/releases/tag/v13.0.0) and read the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) for the details.

**Important information for custom editor developers:** We cleaned up the base editor interfaces and classes (`EditorWithUI`, `EditorUI`, `EditorUIView`, `EditableUIView`) and straightened responsibilities between the UI and the engine (the engine is now the one responsible for managing editable element classes). These changes means that your custom editor implementations will need to be updated. Read more in the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582).

### Release notes

This is a major releases that introduces two new plugins ([autosave](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/saving-data.html) and [block toolbar](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/blocktoolbar.html)), many smaller features, dozens of bug fixes and a couple of infrastructure changes (an upgrade to `webpack@4` and simplified structure of build repositories). Additionally, the `Editor#element` property was renamed to `Editor#sourceElement` and the `Editor#updateElement()` method was renamed to `Editor#updateSourceElement()`.

If you maintain a [custom build of CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html) or [integrate CKEditor 5 from source](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup.html#scenario-2-building-from-source), we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136).

## [1.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0-beta.4) (2018-04-19)

### Release notes

This is a minor release that mainly focuses on stabilizing the [two-step caret movement around links](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/whats-new.html#caret-movement-around-links).

A breaking change was introduced in the [document editor build](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/overview.html#document-editor) – refer to its [changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.4) for more information.

Finally, two new plugins were introduced – [`ParagraphButtonUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_paragraph_paragraphbuttonui-ParagraphButtonUI.html) and [`HeadingButtonsUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_heading_headingbuttonsui-HeadingButtonsUI.html) which make it possible to replace the `headings` dropdown with separate buttons for each heading level.

PS. The `1.0.0-beta.3` version number was skipped in order to align the project version number which diverged from builds version numbers
