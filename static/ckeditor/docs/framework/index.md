    The CKEditor 5 Framework documentation is still in progress, so it may be lacking many things. Feel free to [suggest documentation enhancements](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/labels/type%3Adocs) and share your feedback about the framework.

    If the documentation is insufficient, please do not be afraid of looking into the source code of [CKEditor 5 packages](https://github.com/ckeditor?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ckeditor5&type=public). For example if you plan to create a new feature, check if a similar feature already exists and try to take inspiration from its source code.
